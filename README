Georgian Texts

The idea of this repository is to provide clean and organized data in Georgian language.

This repository contains Georgian author's works and does not have any particular purpose. The texts are well formatted to make tokenizing process easier if you are willing to use it in deep learning. Well, both `complete` and `distinct` sets contains README files for guides.

Contributions are welcome.
