Each directory contains works of different authors. And here are the
rules how `.txt` files are formatted.

Poems:
- Titles starts with `*`
- Untitled works are like `*-`
- Publication, or created(`[year]`) date is placed after the work

Others:
- Each line contains up to 90 characters.
- Words are not broken by hyphens.
- Paragraphs are separated by one line.
